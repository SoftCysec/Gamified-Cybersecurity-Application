## Getting Started

The website is easy to host by design and is primarily static and client-side.
This is done to ensure user privacy, even though some functionalities may work better otherwise.
As a result of that, some design choices may seem odd, a prime example of which is the primitive search function.
You only need a web server with PHP, Python, and the Diceware command line tool for generating passwords.
